### 2. Core AI Concepts

#### A

**Agentic AI**
AI systems capable of autonomous action and decision-making without constant human intervention. These systems can plan, execute, and adjust strategies to achieve goals.

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**
Hypothetical AI with human-level reasoning and problem-solving across any domain. Current AI systems are "narrow" AI, excelling at specific tasks.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
Computer systems designed to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, including visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

#### B

**Bias (in AI)**
Systematic errors in AI outputs that reflect prejudices in training data or algorithm design. Can lead to unfair outcomes for certain groups.

#### C

**Chatbot**
Software application that simulates human conversation through text or voice interactions. Modern chatbots often use large language models.

**Computer Vision**
AI capability to interpret and understand visual information from images or videos, enabling tasks like object detection and facial recognition.

#### D

**Data Lake**
Centralized repository storing raw data in its native format until needed for analysis. Enables flexible data exploration and AI training.

**Deep Learning**
Subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers. Powers advanced AI capabilities like image recognition and language understanding.

#### E

**Embeddings**
Numerical representations of text, images, or other data that capture semantic meaning. Enables AI to find similarities and relationships.

#### F

**Fine-tuning**
Process of adapting a pre-trained AI model for a specific task or domain by training it on additional relevant data.

**Foundation Model**
Large AI model trained on broad data that can be adapted for various tasks. Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini.

#### G

**Generative AI**
AI systems that create new content (text, images, code, audio) based on learned patterns. The technology behind ChatGPT and similar tools.

**GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**
Architecture powering many large language models. Pre-trained on vast text data, then fine-tuned for specific applications.

#### H

**Hallucination**
When AI generates plausible-sounding but false or fabricated information. Important consideration for all generative AI applications.

#### I

**Inference**
The process of using a trained AI model to make predictions or generate outputs on new data.

#### L

**Large Language Model (LLM)**
AI model trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human language. Powers chatbots and writing assistants.

#### M

**Machine Learning (ML)**
Subset of AI where systems learn from data to improve performance without explicit programming. Foundation for most modern AI applications.

**Model**
Mathematical representation learned from data that can make predictions or generate outputs. The core component of AI systems.

#### N

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
AI capability to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Enables chatbots, translation, and sentiment analysis.

**Neural Network**
Computing system inspired by biological neurons. Learns patterns through interconnected nodes processing information.

#### P

**Prompt**
Input text or instructions given to a generative AI model. Prompt quality significantly affects output quality.

**Prompt Engineering**
The practice of designing effective prompts to get desired outputs from AI models.

#### R

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
Technique that combines AI text generation with information retrieval from knowledge bases. Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in real data.

**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**
Training technique using human preferences to improve AI model behavior and alignment with user expectations.

#### S

**Sentiment Analysis**
AI technique to determine emotional tone in text. Used for customer feedback analysis and social media monitoring.

**Supervised Learning**
Machine learning approach using labeled training data. The model learns to map inputs to known outputs.

#### T

**Token**
Unit of text processed by language models. Can be a word, part of a word, or punctuation. Important for understanding AI pricing and limits.

**Training Data**
Dataset used to teach AI models patterns and relationships. Quality and diversity of training data directly impacts model performance.

**Transformer**
Neural network architecture enabling efficient processing of sequential data. Powers modern language models.

#### U

**Unsupervised Learning**
Machine learning approach finding patterns in unlabeled data. Used for clustering, anomaly detection, and data exploration.

#### V

**Vector Database**
Database optimized for storing and searching embeddings. Enables semantic search and AI memory capabilities.
